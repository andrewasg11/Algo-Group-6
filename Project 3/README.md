# Project 3: Opponent Avoidance Problem
created by Andres Perez, Andrew Gonzalez, Desire Hernandez, & Paul Le
## Description
This project tests two algorithms which accomplish the same goal. The objective is to measure the runtime of both algorithms and examine how they match up to our expected time complexities.

##How to run
Enter python3 Project3.py in the terminal. The program will compare the time it takes to process both algorithms given various inputs.
